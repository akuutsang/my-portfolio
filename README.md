# Portfolio
- This repository is mainly for the purpose of designing a portfolio that has a beautiful user interface and is responsive.
## Setting up linters (linters tutorials)
. To set up linters, follow these steps below; (note this linters check is fro ruby it doesnt include html, css or js)
 - git init
 - git add README.md
 - git commit -m "first commit"
 - git branch -M main
 - git remote add origin git@github.com/akuutsang/Learning-Ruby.git
 - git push -u origin main
   Here you are initializing the project using your main branch.
 - after these steps, create a development branch and add a README file and commit push and checkout to development branch.
. In the first commit of your development branch, create a .github/workflows folder and add a copy of .github/workflow/linters.yml (it is very important to remember that the workflow has an S, if u creat a file with just 'workflow' instead of 'workflows' you are bound t experirence errors)

. After creating your folders and files, you can follow the link below, to microverse github account, and chose the type of linters you want, but because we need linters for Html, Css and JavaScript, we will sellect that of the three.
